lab.c compiles into a simple program that takes input from stdin or a 
specified input files and copies it to stdout or a specified output file.

smoketest.sh checks some of the basic functionality and smoketesthelper.sh
makes sure all of the tests are successful. this is what is ultimately
called for make check.

smoke test cases include --segfault option alone, --segfault --catch both,
successful copying of input file to output file, ensuring they're the same
using diff, attempting to access a nonexistent file and checking for the 
correct exit code, and trying to write to a readonly file by checking for
the correct exit code.

make dist will create a tarball of all relevant files to the project and
make clean will purge them all, with the exception of the source files
mentioned above.
